# Spec Review of Agent, Template and Report

## Agent

An Agent is essentially a configuration that includes a specific Prompt and corresponding Examples. Each Agent is designed to handle a particular section within a Template. By leveraging available data sources, an Agent utilizes Generative AI to produce content for its assigned section. The primary goal of an Agent is to generate the desired output as specified by the user for that section.

### Key Components of an Agent:

-   **Prompt**: The initial input or question that guides the Generative AI in creating content. This is the seed text that sets the context for the AI's response.
-   **Examples**: Sample responses or data that help train and refine the AI’s output for accuracy and relevance. Examples serve as a reference for the AI to understand the expected format and quality of the output.
-   **Data Sources**: External or internal databases, APIs, or other repositories from which the Agent can pull information to generate content. These sources provide the factual and contextual basis for the generated content.

### Functionality:

1. **Section Handling**: Each Agent is responsible for a specific section within a Template, ensuring focused and relevant content generation. This modular approach allows for precise control over different parts of the Report.
2. **Generative AI**: Utilizes advanced AI algorithms to create content that meets the user’s requirements. The AI should be capable of understanding the Prompt and Examples to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text.
3. **Customization**: Users can configure Prompts and Examples to tailor the output according to their needs. This customization enables the creation of highly specific and relevant content for each section.

### Implementation Details:

-   **Prompt Configuration**: Developers should provide a user interface where users can input and edit Prompts. This interface should support text formatting and validation to ensure the Prompt is clear and effective.
-   **Example Management**: A system for adding, editing, and deleting Examples should be implemented. Examples should be stored in a way that they can be easily retrieved and used by the AI during content generation.
-   **Data Source Integration**: Agents should have the capability to connect to various data sources. This may require developing connectors for different types of databases, APIs, and other repositories. The data retrieval process should be efficient and secure.

## Template

A Template serves as the structural framework for a Report. It consists of multiple sections, each of which can be populated by an Agent. Templates allow users to design and organize the purpose and content of each section systematically.

### Key Features of a Template:

-   **Structure**: Defines the layout and organization of the Report, including headers, subheaders, and sections. This structural information guides the overall format of the final Report.
-   **Section Composition**: Allows users to specify the purpose and content requirements for each section. Each section can be linked to an Agent for content generation.
-   **Agent Integration**: Sections within the Template can be linked to specific Agents for content generation. This integration ensures that each section is populated with relevant and high-quality content.

### Functionality:

1. **Report Design**: Users can create and modify Templates to suit various reporting needs, ensuring flexibility and adaptability. The design interface should be intuitive and support drag-and-drop functionality for easy arrangement of sections.
2. **Section Management**: Each section can be independently managed and configured, providing granular control over the content. Users should be able to specify the Agent to be used, the Prompt, and any additional settings for each section.
3. **Purpose Definition**: Users can clearly define the objective and desired outcome for each section, guiding the Agents in content creation. This definition helps in setting the right context for the AI.

### Implementation Details:

-   **Template Builder Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface for creating and editing Templates. This interface should allow users to add, remove, and rearrange sections easily.
-   **Section Configuration**: Each section should have settings for linking to an Agent, specifying the Prompt, and other relevant configurations. These settings should be stored and retrieved efficiently.
-   **Validation and Preview**: Implement validation checks to ensure that all necessary configurations are in place. Provide a preview feature that allows users to see how the final Report will look based on the current Template.

## Report

A Report is the final exported output derived from a Template. It compiles the content generated by various Agents into a cohesive document. Reports can be shared with other users and can also be scheduled for automatic generation based on predefined Templates.

### Key Features of a Report:

-   **Exportability**: Reports can be exported in various formats (e.g., PDF, Word, HTML) for easy sharing and distribution. This ensures that the Report can be accessed and viewed on different platforms.
-   **Shareability**: Users can share Reports with colleagues, stakeholders, or clients, facilitating collaboration and communication. Sharing options should include email, direct links, and integration with collaboration tools.
-   **Scheduling**: Templates can be used to schedule the automatic generation of Reports at regular intervals or on specific occasions. This feature ensures that Reports are generated and delivered on time without manual intervention.

### Functionality:

1. **Compilation**: Gathers content from all sections and Agents to form a complete document. The compilation process should ensure that the content is formatted correctly and that all sections are included.
2. **Distribution**: Enables users to share the final Report with others, enhancing accessibility and usability. Distribution methods should be secure and support different levels of access control.
3. **Automation**: Supports the scheduling of Report generation, ensuring timely and consistent delivery of information. Users should be able to set up recurring schedules and specify the delivery method.

### Implementation Details:

-   **Export Engine**: Develop an engine that can convert the compiled content into various formats like PDF, Word, and HTML. This engine should handle formatting, pagination, and other aspects of document generation.
-   **Sharing Mechanism**: Implement a system for sharing Reports that includes options for email, direct links, and integration with collaboration tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams. Ensure that shared Reports are secure and access-controlled.
-   **Scheduling System**: Create a scheduling system that allows users to set up automatic generation of Reports. This system should support different frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly) and handle the delivery of the generated Reports.

By following these detailed specifications, developers can create a robust system for generating, managing, and distributing Reports using Agent Templates. This system will enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of content generation and reporting processes.
